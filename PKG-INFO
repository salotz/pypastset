Description: pyPastSet is a Python implementation of the PastSet tuple-based
        distributed shared memory and computing system.
        
        In some ways PastSet is similar to the classic Linda tuplespace, but with some
        significant differences. In PastSet, tuples are generated dynamically based on
        tuple templates that may also be generated dynamically. Each set of tuples
        based on identical templates is denoted an element of PastSet. An element may
        be seen as representing a trace of interprocess communications in the
        multidimensional space spawned by the tuple template.
        
        In effect, PastSet keeps a sequentially ordered log of all tuples of the same
        or identical templates that have existed in the system. This also allows the
        processes to re-read previously read tuples.
        It is the intention that the added semantics of PastSet will allow programmers
        to more easily create parallel programs that are not limited to the
        traditional ‘bag of tasks’ type.
        
        pyPastSet implements the PastSet tuple memory and process distribution model
        using the powerful Pyro distributed object framework for the core communication
        and SSH for secure remote process spawning.
