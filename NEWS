This file contains sporadic news entries and changelog entries for the
individual releases of the pypastset project code.

A short description of changes 

=== March 20th, 2012 ===
Fix Pyro dependency in setup script.

=== March 9th, 2012 ===
Bug fixes for psclean: more robustness, consistently use environment
settings for all clean commands, properly handle multiple application
arguments. Added PSPKILL environment to allow custom kill command or
script if the pkill tool is not available. 

=== March 1st, 2012 ===
Fix PSWAITPROCS default value to really use PSPROCS as described in the docs. 
Include simple sample pshosts file and a clean up helper.
 
=== July 2nd, 2011 ===
Restructured file layout to get a isolated installation. Added
configuration file support and hooks to integrate with e.g. batch
systems.
 
=== April 25th, 2011 ===
Include psmanage helper to query and monitor active clients. Default to
waiting for all worker processes to register before handing out tasks to
prevent situation where one or more clients fail to register before end
of run and therefore causing exceptions. Logging added in all components.

=== March 27th, 2011 ===
Packaged for easy installation with easy_install and pip. Restructure
executables to better fit system wide installation.

=== March 20th, 2011 ===
X-functions and documentation added to produce the first official
archive for download and use.

=== March 18th, 2011 ===
Today we released the project code under the GPL v2. The release is
available only as source-only repository checkout so far, but a tarball
with basic instructions and documentation will follow soon.
Throughout the coming months we will improve the code and instructions
to ease setup for other users.
