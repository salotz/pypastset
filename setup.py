long_desc = '''pyPastSet is a Python implementation of the PastSet tuple-based
distributed shared memory and computing system.

In some ways PastSet is similar to the classic Linda tuplespace, but with some
significant differences. In PastSet, tuples are generated dynamically based on
tuple templates that may also be generated dynamically. Each set of tuples
based on identical templates is denoted an element of PastSet. An element may
be seen as representing a trace of interprocess communications in the
multidimensional space spawned by the tuple template.

In effect, PastSet keeps a sequentially ordered log of all tuples of the same
or identical templates that have existed in the system. This also allows the
processes to re-read previously read tuples.
It is the intention that the added semantics of PastSet will allow programmers
to more easily create parallel programs that are not limited to the
traditional ‘bag of tasks’ type.

pyPastSet implements the PastSet tuple memory and process distribution model
using the powerful Pyro distributed object framework for the core communication
and SSH for secure remote process spawning.
