= Introduction =
This is the pyPastSet tuple based distributed shared memory system.
The following sections cover installation and basic use of the software. 
pyPastSet is open source software distributed under the GPL v2 license. 
Further license details are available in the COPYING file.

The following sections describes all the steps from obtaining and
installing pyPastSet to actually using it.
 

= Preparation =
In order to use pyPastSet you need Python (http://www.python.org/),
the Pyro framework (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro) and a working SSH
implementation (e.g. http://www.openssh.org).
The optional psclean helper additionally relies on the 'pkill' tool by
default. On Mac OSX and Windows pkill is not available out of the box. On
OSX it can be installed as part of the 'proctools' package from
MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/). The killall tool or a custom script
to kill a process by name in combination with the PSPKILL environment is
another solution.

Please note that pyPastSet silently uses ssh to launch workers on the
nodes listed in the pshosts file, so you may run into login prompts or
errors unless your host(s) are configured for non-interactive ssh
login. Please refer to one of the many online tutorials on setting up
secure login without password like:
http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/152
if you are not familiar with the use of ssh keys.

Additionally the use of Pyro implicitly means that one or more ports are
used for name and object servers. 

If you experience connection problems (e.g. 'gave up locating pastset'
errors) you should make sure that you do not have a firewall preventing
the master server from ssh'ing to the clients or the clients from
talking with the Pyro components on the master server. The main ports
here are typically port 22 for ssh and at least port 9090 and 7766 for
Pyro. 
It is possible to select all the ports used by pyPastSet with the PYRO_*
environment variables, however. Services like SqueezeBox and CiscoSecure
are known to also use TCP port 9090 per default, so if you run any of
those you may want to use the port environments to avoid port conflicts.
Further details are described in the Pyro manual and in the
Debugging Network Problems section below.

The PYRO_* environments may be combined with the PSMASTER environment
that tells pyPastSet where to run the server components.

Technically pyPastSet should work on all platforms, but it has only been
tested on Linux and Mac OSX.


= Installation =
There are numerous ways to install pyPastSet ranging from just
downloading and unpacking for local use to properly installing it
system-wide. We recommend the method described in the Automated
Installation section because it automatically pulls in the required
dependencies and eases installation management.


== Local Installation ==
For isolated testing simply download and unpack the tarball from
http://code.google.com/p/pypastset/downloads/list
or grab the latest version from the code repository as described on
http://code.google.com/p/pypastset/source/checkout 
and the code can be used from there without any need for administrator
privileges.
It is also possible to use pyPastSet from other locations in the file system
as long as the PSROOT and PYTHONPATH environments are set to the path of
the unpacked directory.


== Automated Installation ==
The fastest way to install pyPastSet system-wide is to just point pip
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) or easy_install
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) to the latest pastset release
from the official Python Package Index (pypi.python.org):
```
pip install pastset
```
or
```
easy_install pastset
```

If you want to install another version you can use the explicit download
location:
```
pip install http://pypastset.googlecode.com/files/pastset-$VERSION.tar.gz
```
or
```
easy_install http://pypastset.googlecode.com/files/pastset-$VERSION.tar.gz
```
Please note that you should then modify the url to the actual version you
want to install. 
In any case you will likely need to run the install command as a
privileged user.


== Manual Installation ==
After obtaining the source as described in the Local Installation
section it can be installed using the standard python distutils method
of running:
```
python setup.py install
```
as a privileged user.
This will install pyPastSet system wide, but has the drawback that
upgrading or uninstalling it again later may be a bit cumbersome. The
pip method mentioned above or the RPM/DEB package methods below make
future upgrades or uninstallation clean and easy.


=== Deb Packages ===
On DEB-based systems like Debian and Ubuntu Linux the installation can
be integrated with the system package systems using e.g. the stdeb
software:
```
sudo apt-get install python-stdeb
python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
sudo dpkg -i deb_dist/python-pastset_VERSION-1_all.deb
```

=== RPM Packages ===
On RPM-based systems like Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Cent OS the
installation can be integrated with the system package systems using
e.g. the bdist_rpm target:
```
python setup.py bdist_rpm
sudo rpm -i rpm_dist/python-pastset-VERSION.rpm
```


= Upgrading =
Upgrading a pyPastSet installation is just a matter of repeating the
installation steps with the new version. You may want to take the
uninstallation steps first to make sure it is a clean upgrade, but it
should not be strictly necessary.


= Uninstall =
If you installed pyPastSet with pip uninstall is just a matter of
calling the corresponding uninstall command:
```
sudo pip uninstall pastset
```
If you used one of the DEB or RPM package methods you can simply use
your preferred package manager to uninstall the python-pastset or
pastset package again.
For the local or manual distutils installation you need to manually
delete the installed files to uninstall.


= Environment Settings =
It is possible to tell pyPastSet to use different settings internally
trough the setting of environment variables:
PSBIN:       which directory path to search for your application (default ".")
PSROOT:      path of directory with PastSet installation (default ".")
PSMASTER:    name of the master server (default ""), empty means current host
PSHOSTS:     path of hosts file (default ""), empty means use only localhost
PSPROCS:     number of clients to launch using hosts file order (default "1")
PSSSH:       ssh command used to run application on nodes (default "ssh")
PSPYTHON:    python command used to run application on nodes (default "python")
PSPKILL:     pkill command used to kill process by name (default "pkill -9 -f")
PSWAITPROCS: number of clients ready before scheduling jobs (default "PSPROCS")
PSLOGPATH:   where to write internal log (default ""), empty means no log
PSLOGLEVEL:  log level: debug/info/warning/error/critical (default "warning")
PSCONFHELP:  path to the optional PastSet configuration helper (default "")

Additionally all Pyro environments described in the Install section of the
Pyro manual can be used to change Pyro defaults like port numbers:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~irmen/pyro3/manual/3-install.html

Finally the standard PATH and PYTHONPATH environments are useful for
getting access to executables and python modules outside the default OS
installation locations. However, PYTHONPATH it is not needed as long as
you run your pyPastSet applications from the installation location or
install it system-wide as described above.


= Configuration Files =
Configuration files are optional but they can be used to control
pyPastSet like the environments mentioned above.
They use the standard "ini" file format and options simply reuse the
above environment names. Thus a valid configuration could be:
```
[DEFAULT]
# Change log level to info for all runs
PSLOGLEVEL = info
```
It is equivalent of automatically setting the PSLOGLEVEL environment to
'info' for all pyPastSet commands without that environment value set.

The actual configuration file paths are platform dependent but they can
be found in the output of 
```
pypsrun -h
```


= Examples =
A pyPastSet setup includes a scheduler/server, a number of clients and
one or more pyPastSet applications. It is possible to manually start
each of those with manual calls to pypsscheduler, pypsclient and the
application, but it is recommended to use the pypsrun helper to automate
it all.
The pypsrun command makes it easy to run such a full PastSet instance
and an application with a single command from the install directory:
```
PATH=$PATH:$PWD PYTHONPATH=$PWD pypsrun examples/simple.py
```

If pyPastSet is installed system-wide the correspoding command would be:
```
pypsrun simple.py
```
if called from a directory with the simple.py example application.

In effect this launches PastSet and runs the simple.py example
application with a single worker process on localhost. The resulting
output is something like:
```
2011-07-02 18:47:29,511 psrun WARNING No PSHOSTS provided - only using localhost
0 1
(42, 3.1400000000000001)
1 1
```

Multiple workers can be launched with the PSPROCS and PSBIN environments
as seen with the Monte Carlo pi example and a local installation:
```
PATH=$PATH:$PWD PYTHONPATH=$PWD PSPROCS=4 PSBIN=$PWD/examples ./pypsrun \
    mcpiserver.py 4 10 1000000
```
or for system wide installations with example scripts in ~/apps simply:
```
PSPROCS=4 PSBIN=~/apps pypsrun mcpiserver.py 4 10 1000000
```

This time four mcpiclient.py workers are launched from the application
but because we did not provide a custom hosts file through the PSHOSTS
environment all processes will still be launched at localhosts to yield
output like:
```
2011-07-02 18:49:11,666 psrun WARNING No PSHOSTS provided - only using localhost
2011-07-02 18:49:11,666 More client processes than hosts - wrapping around
Pi is found as 3.141791 with 4 worker(s), 10 bag(s) and bagsize of 1000000
```
The actual pi value will fluctuate due to the nature of the randomized 
Monte Carlo simulation. Both mcpiserver.py and mcpiclient.py are
automatically taken from the examples directory due to the PSBIN setting.

If your PastSet application or worker scripts that it spawns are located
somewhere else it is necessary to point the PSBIN environment there. As
an example with the simple.py example saved in the ~/apps directory, a
copy of the default hosts file in ~/pshosts and pyPastSet installed in
~/pypastset we could use:
```
PATH=$PATH:~/pypastset PYTHONPATH=~/pypastset PSHOSTS=~/pshosts \
		       PSROOT=~/pypastset PSBIN=~/apps \
		       ~/pypastset/pypsrun simple.py
```
to get the same result as above.


If pyPastSet is installed system-wide the correspoding command would be
just:
```
PSHOSTS=~/pshosts PSBIN=~/apps pypsrun simple.py
```

The hosts file is just a flat file containing a single hostname on each
line. For a cluster with the nodes n0, n1, .. n7 the hosts file could
thus contain the lines:
```
n0
n1
n2
n3
n4
n5
n6
n7
```

More example applications are included with the code, so it may be a
good idea to look a e.g. spawntest.py and xmcpiserver.py to get started.


= Debugging Network Problems =
We recommend leaving PSMASTER unset or set it to the address of the host
where you launch pypsrun and then use the PYRO_* environments to keep the
Pyro setup as simple as possible while debugging.
Let's consider the same example where we have nodes n0 to n7 and run
pypsrun from n0. We decide to only use the two ports 7777 and 7778 in
this example. 
First we set PSMASTER to the node where we run pypsrun from to keep all
the pyPastSet server components there:
```
export PSMASTER=n0
```

Then we tell pyPastSet to use port 7777 on the same node for both the
Pyro name server and broadcast helper:
```
export PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME=n0
export PYRO_NS_PORT=7777
export PYRO_NS_BC_PORT=7777
```

Finally we tell pyro to serve objects on port 7778 and not try to
relocate to additional ports:
```
export PYRO_PORT=7778
export PYRO_PORT_RANGE=1
```

With the pshosts file from above and a copy of the mcpiserver.py and
mcpiclient.py scripts in the ~/apps directory, the resulting command
would then be:
PSHOSTS=pshosts PSPROCS=8 PSLOGLEVEL=debug PSBIN=~/apps pypsrun \
		mcpiserver.py 8 100 1000

If this simple setup still fails or hangs you can try to manually run
the ssh commands and the Pyro commands.
First make sure that the commands
```
ssh $PSMASTER hostname
ssh n1 hostname
...
ssh n7 hostname
```
completes without errors.

Then try launching the pyro name server in the background on the master:
```
ssh $PSMASTER pyro-ns -n $PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME -p $PYRO_NS_PORT &
```
and access it from each of the other nodes in turn:
```
ssh n1 pyro-nsc -h $PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME -p $PYRO_NS_PORT list
...
ssh n7 pyro-nsc -h $PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME -p $PYRO_NS_PORT list
```
The output should be something like:
Locator: contacting Pyro Name Server...
NS is at 10.0.0.1 (n0) port 7777
:Default --> ( )
for each node.
Finally you can stop the name server again with the command:
```
ssh n1 pyro-nsc -h $PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME -p $PYRO_NS_PORT shutdown
```

Hopefully these steps will help you pin point the problem, but feel free
to ask otherwise.


= System Integration =
It is possible to further integrate pyPastSet with e.g. local batch
systems like PBS, SGE, SLURM and so on. The optional PSCONFHELP setting
allows inline execution of a python script just before additional
environment settings are parsed in pyPastSet. Thus such scripts can use
whatever enviroment settings or files the batch system provides to
control the pyPastSet execution.
I.e. if the batch system sets the NODECOUNT environment to the number of
available job nodes and the NODEFILE to the path of a pyPastSet
compatible nodes file, a simple python script could be used to transfer
that information to pyPastSet components through the PSPROCS and PSHOSTS
environments:
```
# Inline python script to transfer allocated job node specs to pyPastSet
# components 

import os

os.environ['PSPROCS'] = os.environ['NODECOUNT']
os.environ['PSHOSTS'] = os.environ['NODESFILE']
```

The configuration file could then just set PSCONFHELP to the path of
this script.
